      Task: Create a function orderCoffee that takes a callback function as a
      parameter. Inside orderCoffee, use setTimeout to simulate coffee being
      prepared in 3 seconds. When coffee is ready, call the callback function to
      let the customer know.

    <h2>
      Exercise 2: Pizza Order with Promises 🍕 Now, let’s improve the system
      using Promises instead of callbacks! Create a function orderPizza that
      returns a Promise. Inside, use setTimeout to simulate pizza baking in 5
      seconds. If the order is successful, the promise resolves with "Pizza is
      ready! 🍕" Use .then() to print "Eating the pizza now!"

    <h2>
      📝 Task: Simulating a Multi-Step Process You will write an async function
      called processData that does the following: Logs "Starting process..."
      immediately. Waits 2 seconds, then logs "Step 1: Data received ✅". Waits
      another 2 seconds, then logs "Step 2: Processing data...⌛". Waits another
      2 seconds, then randomly decides whether the process succeeds or fails:
      Success (50% chance) → Logs "Step 3: Process completed successfully! 🎉"
      Failure (50% chance) → Logs "Step 3: Process failed ❌" 🔹 Use
      a random number to determine success or failure.
