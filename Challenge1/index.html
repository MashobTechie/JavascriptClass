      Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
      calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height *
      height) (mass in kg and height in meter). Your tasks: 1. Store Mark's and
      John's mass and height in variables 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the
      formula (you can even implement both versions) 3. Create a Boolean
      variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a
      higher BMI than John
