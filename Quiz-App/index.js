// Simple Quiz App Assignment 📝
// Task Overview:
// You will build a simple quiz app that:
// ✅ Displays one question at a time with multiple-choice options.
// ✅ Shows whether the selected answer is correct or wrong.
// ✅ Moves to the next question when the "Next" button is clicked.
// ✅ Displays an alert when the quiz is completed.

// How It Works:
// Display the question and four answer options as buttons.
// When a user clicks on an option, highlight the selection and show whether it is correct or wrong.
// Click "Next" to move to the next question
// After the final question, show an alert saying, "Quiz Completed!"

// Hints for Implementation:
// 📌 HTML: Use a div to display the question and button elements for answer choices.
// 📌 CSS: Style the selected answer to indicate correct (green) or incorrect (red).
// 📌 JavaScript:

// Use document.querySelector() to get elements.
// Add an event listener to each answer button to check if it’s correct.
