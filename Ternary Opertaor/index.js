// Ternary Operator
// It is used for writing cositions. 
// Tenary Operator follows this pattern
// condition ? response if true : resposne if false

let myAge = 20
// To check if i'm eligible to vote

// For If Else Statement
if (myAge >= 18) {
    console.log(`Eligible to vote`)
} else {
    console.log(`Not eligible to vote`)
}

// For Ternary Operator
myAge >= 18 ? console.log(  `Eligible to vote`) : console.log(`Not eligible to vote`)


// Assignment.
// Using Ternary Operator
// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25”
// Test data:
//  Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
// Hints:
//  To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
//  Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300
