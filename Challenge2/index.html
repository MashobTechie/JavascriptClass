      Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes
      eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill
      value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
      Your tasks: 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a
      variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else
      statement � (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else
      statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!) 2. Print a
      string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final
      value (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the
      total value 316.25
