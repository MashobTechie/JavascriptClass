ðŸ›’ Mini E-Commerce Store - Project Description
ðŸ“Œ Overview
In this project, youâ€™ll build a simple e-commerce store using JavaScript and the FakeStore API. This store will display a list of products, allow users to view details, and even add items to a shopping cart.

This project will help you practice working with APIs, handling dynamic data, and manipulating the DOM.

ðŸ“Œ What Youâ€™ll Build
Product Listing Page â€“ Displays products fetched from the FakeStore API.

Filter by Category â€“ Users can filter products (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).

Product Details Page â€“ Clicking a product shows more details (price, description, image).

Shopping Cart (Basic) â€“ Users can add/remove items, and the cart is stored in localStorage.

Cart Summary Page (Bonus) â€“ Shows total price and items in the cart.

ðŸ“Œ Getting Started
Fetch product data from FakeStore API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products).

Display the products dynamically on the page.

Allow users to view product details when clicked.

Implement a simple cart system (store data in localStorage).
